Pull Request Release Notes utility generates release notes for all merged pull requests, on a specific branch, that have not yet been released replying only on pull request titles and labels to generate the release notes. 

Supported Pull Request providers are [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), [TFS / Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx), [BitBucket Cloud](https://bitbucket.org/) and [Bitbucket Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download). 

Intention is to run this utility as part of a continuous integration process and generate notes automatically as part of every release branch build. Optionally the utility can also publish the notes to a markdown file, [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) page or a [Slack](https://slack.com/) post. 

Utility outputs release notes following the [Semantic Release Notes](http://www.semanticreleasenotes.org/) format and extracts semantic release note sections, categories and summaries from the pull request title and labels. For example all pull requests with `Bug` label can be grouped under `Fixes` section and pull requests with `Enhancement` label can be grouped under `Enhancements` section. Category grouping is possible through use of the `#Label` where `#` character is used to denote a category label as opposed to a section label.

NOTE: TFS / Team Services and BitBucket Cloud / Server pull request providers do not have a label concept yet so for those providers you can type `[#section]` and `[##category]` either in the title or the description of the pull request as a pseudo-label.
